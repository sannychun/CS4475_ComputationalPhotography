INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download any image of a tree, field, lanscape, whatever. Make sure that it contains as much green as possible.
   The dimensions does not matter.
2. Save that image as input.jpg IN THE SAME FOLDER AS THE CODE.
3. Run the code (if using PyCharm like me, Alt+Shift+X)
4. Check that fallImage.jpg, winterImage.jpg, and imageMask.jpg are created.
