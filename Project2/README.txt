#Project 2 "Cartoon Effect"

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Download any image and name it "source.jpg" in the same folder as the Python code. 
	Do not worry About the size; it will be downscaled automatically if needed.
3. Run the code (if using PyCharm like me, Alt+Shift+X)
4. The code has succeeded if the final output image pops up. Also, check the folder to see if "mask.jpg" and "cartoon.jpg" are created.
